# Professional Portfolio

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

## Description

This is my professional portfolio. The intention is to show this to prospective employers in the hope that they'll like the projects within and hire me. 

## Website

You can access the deployed website here:

## Dead Links

A number of the links are dead, as this is a work in progress. 
* There is no resume. 
* The contact me section doesn't have any working links. 
* The only project that isn't a placeholder is Run Buddy.

## Credits

* I followed the mock up from UofA Coding Bootcamp Challenge 2.
* All images are from Wikimedia Commons.
